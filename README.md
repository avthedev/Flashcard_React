# Flashcard App

This project was made for users studying to be able to create a deck of flashcards. Using flashcards can be a very effective studying approach. Flashcards are often part of spaced practice, and repetition helps you figure out what information you can remember easily and what needs additional effort.

## Motivation

This was created as part of my project for the Thinkful Software Engineering course. This project helped me a lot in learning and practicing React and React hooks. I hope to one day come back to this project and add styling to it.
